# Testing

Hello Everyone !!

This is my testing repo in which I have made multiple scripts to sync, update, upgrade the environment etc that you will need for building a custom rom.
Here you can currently see :
1. Lineage OS
2. AEX 
3. EVO 
4. PEX [Whyred]
5. Ubuntu.sh [ This can be used to install a desktop in your gcp or any other server]

Thankyou for Visiting!! ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Š
